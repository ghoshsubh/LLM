1:The author wrote the book, but no one will give him the credit for writing it.

You've done the work on your own. I've done the work on my own. We know it's a mistake to do the work jointly.

What's wrong with you?

I'm the one who is doing the work and trying to change the world. I mean, I write about everything, I make documentaries about it: "We're on top of the world." And I was interviewed a few years ago, and I said: "But we're on top of the world, you know, there's just so many people who don't know this..."

And the interviewer says: "Why don't they know it?" And I said: "I don't know, I'm just telling it, you know."

It's my life.

That it?

Yeah, and I say: "And what happens to all this?" And the interviewer says: "Well, how can they get rich if nothing goes wrong?" And I said: "Well, what happens is they'll sell their company and say, 'Oh, we're going to give more shares to the shareholders, because they've been fooled, they've been conned, we're all on the take.'"

He said: "But that's wrong, that's not right." And I said: "Yes it is, because there is no trust for corporate managers any more, because most of the companies are going bankrupt, just like Enron. So they all have to say 'Here it is: I promise we'll give the shareholders more share.' And all the shareholders say: 'Who's we?' And who's the boss of the company? We're the shareholders. No one trusts anybody else."

And to this day, people have no confidence in me. Nobody trusts me. But what can I do? It's me. I can only do the work and hope that there is some other person out there that's going to believe it. And if there is somebody out there who does believe it, and they will help me in my task, I'll continue to do it.

Does it bother you that people don't believe in you? Or did you get out as many people as you could?

I've said I have no regrets.

Nobody has a right to have regrets.

No. I get very angry about things that I

3:The author wrote the book, but he and the editors of the book's publisher wanted to take out an article about the Jewish involvement in the slave trade or the Holocaust. They decided against it, but had an editor do all that he could.

But, he said, he has done everything he could do.

His first book, written with "Echoes of Hope" co-authors J.B. Rifkin and Jeffrey Gurock, was just released in 2008 and detailed the rise, fall, and resurrection of his family's business, which included shipping cargo across the Pacific.

The book covered how he came to be an American hero and how he spent the intervening years fighting a war that he said "went on long after he had gone."

Kasparov was in the crowd for the first three rounds; he will face Spassky in the fourth.

For a decade, the two men have played as tough competition, with one claiming to have played the better chess — or at least the harder one.

That began to change late last year, when Spassky announced that the Russian had finally caught up — on the game of the year of 2011.

"It was the longest game in history … by the time I got close" Kasparov said.

They began playing a series of match-finish tournaments in Europe at the end of last year. Both claimed the lead at one or more points, but their rivals held strong in the deciding games.

This past week, Kramnik and Carlsen, both of whom have never played a computer program, faced off in a blitz tournament in Norway to determine the best computer program that still had a shot at beating the human.

There was much excitement in the crowd at both events because the computers' performance indicated that computers still can beat the best players of the world even after decades of work.

In the second game of the match, Spassky said the Russian had "a lot of interesting, tactical ideas" but that he'd been "forced out of their plan."

As in previous blitz tournaments, both agreed on a draw. That's when Kasparov, who is very good at computer-board tactics, called a bluff — asking Kasparov to make some moves, in particular to move the queens and set up a winning win for Black, or for White to make some moves, in particular to move pawns and take
4:The author wrote the book, but I think he got the most credit," he says.

"I feel a great responsibility to say the things that I might have said that didn't make it in."

He says the book is about his relationship with his sister.

"It's more of a memoir, so not every line is about me in a general way."

The book is based on interviews with his daughter, who is the mother of his second wife.

5:The author wrote the book, but he never really planned to give it any press, or to see anyone, let alone sell it to anyone. His publishers, however, wanted to push it out in paperback – which is the way things go, with a book like that. They hired the best publishing houses in New York and London. This is where the trouble started. In the United States, the best publishers are very high up in society, and they're very well connected. These publishers have always had a problem when it comes to books by authors of different ethnicity, because there is a tendency, sometimes with good reason, to want to put out books that only appeal to people inside the mainstream. This happens in all kinds of industries.

At the top of the American publishing chain is Penguin, whose chairman and chief executive, Kenneth Cole, is from Canada. He's very aware of the American obsession with the notion of books only for people of like mind. If an author from around the world is published in America, it's only a matter of time before he's sent back to Europe. The best-selling books in the United States, when it comes to people like me, are by white authors. It's true in Britain, too – but not necessarily more noticeable. In England, a white author sells far better than an Asian one.

So I had a difficult time making the case to London publishers, and then publishers in other parts of the world. The publishers in London, of course, were very aware of the way people in New York were thinking. It was very uncomfortable.

"I had to talk about the way people in New York think"

On this basis, however, I could say the book was a disappointment. I tried to do something a little bit different. I had planned to write the most controversial thing I could think of because people would say, "Well, you have to deal with racial issues." But it's one thing to deal with racial issues and another thing to deal with religion – which in many countries isn't just about skin colour – but about religion and beliefs. I had to talk about the way people in America think about religion, but in a very clear and very humane way. I was forced to talk about the way the British people have, as a country, developed an incredibly intense dislike of other people who do not look like them – the Muslims and the black people – and the way they view these groups. I also had to deal with
